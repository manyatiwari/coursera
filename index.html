                <h2>Self Love</h2>
                <p>
                    Self love forms the foundation of your single, most important relationship - that with yourself.
                    The strength of all your other relationships is exactly equal to the strength of that foundation.
                     To love yourself is not just a self-esteem boosting piece of advice. It is the prerequisite to truly loving others.

                     Self-reliance is the ability of commitment and effort for providing the necessities of life for self and other family members.
                     The habit of doing our own work ourselves without depending on others is called self-reliance.
                     It is a noble quality in human nature and is found in the life of all great man and women.
